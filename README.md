### How it works
- The executable is located in the folder where the README is located and named `InputToTxt.exe`
- Make sure you have the machine plugged in to the pc before you launch the executable




### How to use
- When you open the executable, the first thing you need to do is to input the COM PORT
  - The program will not run without COM PORT
  - There is 2 ways to see which COM PORT is used for the machine
  - use the MaxSSD software provided for a SEALEVEL and check the PORT there
  - OR go to Device Manager on Windows and open the Ports (COM & LPT) and check for SealO USB Expansion interface COMPORT
